# Issues
* use after free in some formulas, irreguar: I cant reproduce
* a formula without closing parenthesis falls into an inf loop
* set digit from forula breaks it

# Todo
* Improve input: arrow movement
* Improve UI and UI customization
* Colors?
* Add color to input
* Improve input: handle special chars other than bs and cr
* maybe move from ast-walking to vm in formulas
* improve update screen when it isn't needed to update the full screen

# No tested at all

* behaviour of corne cases in formulas for buitlins, 
    ranges and comparison.
