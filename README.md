## Builtin functions
Builtin functions can be called in formulas. It take numbers, text or cells as 
arguments and return a value. 
* **sum(...)**: Sum zero or more arguments and return the result as if adding it
  one by one.
* **mul(...)**: Multiply zero or more arguments. 
* **avg(...)**: Get the average of zero or more values. 
* **count(...)**: Get the number of non empty arguments.
* **min(...)**: Get the min number between arguments.
* **max(...)**: Get the max number between arguments.
* **if(cond, iftrue [, else])**: Get the value depending on the condition.
* **color(color, cells [, ...])**: Apply color to one or more cells
* **colorb(color, cells [, ...])**: Apply color if not done yet to one or more
  cells
* **literal(v)**: Evaluates to v, literally. Can be used to store numbers as
  strings.

> Functions accept ranges as parameters. They are two valid cells separated by
> a `:`. For example, `sum(A0:A9)` is the same as sum the 10 first numbers in
> row `A`.

## Configuration
You can modify some values using the vicel config file. This file is searched in
the following paths: `./vicel.toml`, `~/vicel.toml`, `~/.config/vicel.toml`,
`~/.config/vicel/vicel.toml`. If other file is desired to be used it can be
specified with the `-c` or `--config-file` flag, following with the full path of
the config file. The format chosen for the file is [toml](https://toml.io). 

The valid fields whith their default values are set [here](#vicel.toml).

## Latest Version
[See version](./version.txt)

## Lines of Code
[Lines written](./wc.md) A little reflection: the fewer the lines, the better.
I like to flex on how little code is needed for a fully functional program.

## Status
> Itâ€™s **kinda usable** for now.
