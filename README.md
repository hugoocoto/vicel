## Mappings
> *As of the time of writing*

### Movement
* `h`, `l`, `j`, `k`: Move cursor left, right, down, up
* `$`: Go to last cell of the current row
* `^`: Go to first cell of the current row
* `gg`: Go to first cell of the current column
* `G`: Go to last cell of the current column
* `g0`: Same as `gg` and `^`

### Editing
* `i`: Input/edit current cell
* `d`: Delete cell (set as empty)
* `v`: Toggle cell selection (useless)

### Insert + move
* `gij`, `gik`, `gih`, `gil`: Insert input and move in the given direction

### Add rows/columns
* `gj`: Add a new row
* `gl`: Add a new column

### Expand cells
* `J`, `K`, `H`, `L`: Expand current cell down, up, left, right (and move)

### Misc
* `q`: Quit
* `r`: Re-render the screen

## Input Format
Press `i` while the cursor is on a cell.
Supported formats:
* **Numbers**: Decimal numbers like `-10`, `3.14`
* **Text**: Any non-number string
* **Formula**: Starts with `=`, e.g. `=C2 + 8.5`

>  Cell references are of the form `A1`, `B3`, etc.

## Builtin functions
Builtin functions can be called in formulas. It take numbers, text or cells as 
arguments and return a value. 
* **sum(...)**: Sum zero or more arguments and return the result as if adding it one by one.
* **mul(...)**: Multiply zero or more arguments. 
* **avg(...)**: Get the average of zero or more values. 
* **count(...)**: Get the number of non empty arguments.

> Functions accept the keyword `:` that expand both cell operands with all
> the cells in between. For example, `A0:A2` is the same as `A0,A1,A2`.

## Latest Version
[See version](./version.txt)

## Lines of Code
[Lines written](./wc.md) A little reflection: the fewer the lines, the better.
I like to flex on how little code is needed for a fully functional program.

## Status
> Itâ€™s **kinda usable** for now.

## Known issues
* Circular references crash the program
* Read csv with , " , ", Split cell at , although the quotes.
* Support arrows for movement
* Improve input: use prev input
* Improve input: arrow movement
* Broken on gij because of line clearing
