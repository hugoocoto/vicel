== Abstract
Vicel is a free open source TUI spreadsheet editor. You can read, modify and
save data stored in rows and columns. It aims to be an alternative to
proprietary non gratis well known Microsoft program, for non professional usage
(as it is quite simple, al least for now).

== About development
For now it is being developed by Hugo Coto as a side project. He does that
because for college reasons he has to use the Windows-only mouse-centered
similar and he almost went ill. The plan for the future is to reach a stable
version with all and no more than the useful and needed features to have an
usable program for non professional usage. What I mean with no professional is
that it's not planned to support any graphs neither economic formulas or such
specific things. It's true that with builtins someone can adapt vicel to his own
necessities.

== Installation
This section would guide you to install vicel from source. Source is
available in #link("https://github.com/hugoocoto/vicel", "github"). First,
it's needed to clone the repo to your own machine.
```sh
git clone "https://github.com/hugoocoto/vicel"
cd vicel
```

Then, there are two options to install it.
+ Local installation: run ```sh make```.
+ Global installation: run ```sh make install```. This would move the
  executable to #smallcaps("~/.local/bin"), make sure this route is in path.

After installation, it will be available. Note that local installation requires
```sh ./vicel``` while if installed globally it can be called just by name:
```sh vicel```.

== Open Vicel
As vicel is a TUI program you have to start it from the command line. If you
installed it in #smallcaps("~/.local/bin") then you can start it as a
normal terminal tool:
```sh
vicel filename [options]
```
If the filename is omitted it opens an unnamed sheet. Note that this sheet
can't be saved. Also, you can't open more than one file at the same time.

=== Options
The options supported are the following:

#table(
  columns: 2,
  stroke: none,
  table.header("Command", "Description"),
  table.hline(),
  [`-m`, `--use-mouse`  ], [Enable mouse support],
  [`-D`, `--debug`      ], [Enable debug output ],
  [`-c`, `--config-file`], [Set custom file path],
)

For example, if you want to open the file #smallcaps("./sheets/table.csv") with
a config file in #smallcaps("./config/vicel.toml"), the command line should
looks like that:
```sh
vicel sheets/table.csv -c config/vicel.toml
```

== Moving around
As a vim enthusiast, movement is keyboard centered, and use the vim default
#smallcaps("hjkl"). Every action can be prefixed with a number, so it would be
executed that amount of times. The following table describes the basic movement.

#table(
  columns: 2,
  stroke: none,
  table.header("Command", "Description"),
  table.hline(),
  [ `h`, `l`, `j`, `k`], [ Move cursor left, right, down, up],
  [ `$`], [ Go to last cell of the current row],
  [ `^`], [ Go to first cell of the current row],
  [ `gg`], [ Go to first cell of the current column],
  [ `G`], [ Go to last cell of the current column],
  [ `g0`], [ Same as `^` and `gg`],
)

== Write or edit
To write text in a cell, move the cursor there and press `i`. A text input box
would be open at the cell. After writing, press #smallcaps("Enter") to save it.
The data type would be automatically calculated by the program. Every number,
with or without a fractional part separated by a dot would be interpreted as a
#smallcaps("Number"). If the text written starts with a equal sign it would be
interpreted as a formula. Other formats would be set to #smallcaps("Text").

#table(
  columns: 2,
  stroke: none,
  table.header("Command", "Description"),
  table.hline(),
  [i], [insert/modify text],
  [d], [delete cell content],
  [v], [toggle cell selection],
)

The valid types are described in the following table by it's formal
representation.

#table(
  columns: 2,
  stroke: none,
  table.header("Type", "Formal"),
  table.hline(),
  [#smallcaps("Number")], [[0-9]+("."[0-9]+)?],
  [#smallcaps("Formula")], ["=" #smallcaps("Formula body")],
  [#smallcaps("Text")], [!#smallcaps("Number") && !#smallcaps("Formula")],
)

=== Formula
Formulas are expressions that evaluate to a valid value. They start with an
equal sign. The function body have to contain a valid expression.

#table(
  columns: 3,
  stroke: none,
  table.header("Type", "Description", "Example"),
  table.hline(),
  [Literal], [Number, text, identifier or range], [see below],
  [Number], [As cell type #smallcaps("Number")], [5987, 45.6],
  [Text], [Alphas or text surrounded by `'`], [hello, '5.9'],
  [Identifier], [Cell reference by name as #smallcaps("ColRow")], [A0, b5, ZZ98],
  [Range], [Cell range as #smallcaps("ID:ID")], [A0:A2, A7:C8],
  [Arithmetic operators], [Evaluate arithmetic expressions], [+, -, /, \*, ^],
  [Comparison operators], [Compare two expressions], [>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=, !],
  [functions], [Reserved names that convert some input in some output, with the form #smallcaps("name(args,...)")],
  [sum(A0,A1)],
  table.hline(),
  [Todo: expand formula reference], [], [],
)

=== Builtin functions
Builtin functions can be called in formulas. It takes numbers, text or cells as
arguments and return a value.
- *sum(...)*: Sum zero or more arguments and return the result as if adding it
  one by one.
- *mul(...)*: Multiply zero or more arguments.
- *avg(...)*: Get the average of zero or more values.
- *count(...)*: Get the number of non empty arguments.
- *min(...)*: Get the min number between arguments.
- *max(...)*: Get the max number between arguments.
- *if(cond, iftrue [, else])*: Get the value depending on the condition.
- *color(color, cells [, ...])*: Apply color to one or more cells
- *colorb(color, cells [, ...])*: Apply color if not done yet to one or more
  cells
- *literal(v)*: Evaluates to v, literally. Can be used to store numbers as
  strings.

Functions accepts ranges as parameters. They are two valid cells separated by
a `:`. For example, `sum(A0:A9)` is the same as sum the first 10 numbers in
row `A`.

=== Advanced write: write and move
There is a builtin feature to automatically move before insert text. It is
useful if you need to input a big amount of data in a given direction. The idea
is to prefix the following commands with a number, to do it for a given
amount of times.

#table(
  columns: 2,
  stroke: none,
  table.header("Command", "Description"),
  table.hline(),
  [gih, gij, gik, gil], [insert text and move in the given direction],
)

== Modify sheet structure
There are some commands to add/delete rows and columns. Note that formula
identifier would not change on row/col insertion/deletion.

#table(
  columns: 2,
  stroke: none,
  table.header("Command", "Description"),
  table.hline(),
  [`g#`], [ Add s row/column: see below],
  [`gd#`], [ Delete a row/column: see below],
  [`gj`], [ Add a new row after the cursor],
  [`gl`], [ Add a new column after the cursor],
  [`gk`], [ Add a new row before the cursor],
  [`gh`], [ Add a new column before the cursor],
  [`gJ`], [ Add a new row at the end ],
  [`gL`], [ Add a new column at the end],
  [`gK`], [ Add a new row at the start ],
  [`gH`], [ Add a new column at the start],
  [`gdj`], [ Delete row and move up],
  [`gdl`], [ Delete column and move right],
  [`gdk`], [ Delete row and move down],
  [`gdh`], [ Delete column and move left],
)

== Expand cells
There is a feature to fill the next cell value based on the previous one and a
direction. Numbers add 1 and formula identifiers recalculate depending on the
direction. You can prevent modification by prefixing the identifier with `$`
before the column letter (freeze column) or number (freeze row). The mappings to
do this are described in the following table.

#table(
  columns: 2,
  stroke: none,
  table.header("Command", "Description"),
  table.hline(),
  [`J`, `K`, `H`, `L`], [Expand current cell down, up, left, right (and move)],
)

== Copy - Paste
As a vim user, you might want to copy-paste things around. Unfortunately, it's
only possible to copy a single cell value and paste it in a single cell. Note
that deletion also copy the content of the cell, it would sound natural for vim
users.

#table(
  columns: 2,
  stroke: none,
  table.header("Command", "Description"),
  table.hline(),
  [p], [paste],
  [y], [yank (copy)],
)

== Other commands
There are another useful commands, described below.

#table(
  columns: 2,
  stroke: none,
  table.header("Command", "Description"),
  table.hline(),
  [q], [Save and quit],
  [w], [Write (save)],
  [r], [Re-render the screen],
  [Ctrl-c], [Quit without save],
)

== Mouse support
Despite the early development idea was to create a fully mouseless experience,
some users may find convenient to do some actions with their mouse. It can be
enabled setting the option #smallcaps("window.use_mouse") to #smallcaps("true").

This is an experimental feature. At the time of writing, the cursor follows the
mouse and you can drag and drop cell values using left click (drag on press,
drop on release).

Left click over a cell enters insert mode. If you click on a cell, its name
would be appended to input. If you press the mouse over the cell A and move to
the cell B and then release the left button, the range A:B would be written.

== Configuration

=== vicel.toml

#box(
  stroke: black,
  inset: 10pt,
)[#align(horizon)[Because of the #smallcaps("toml") parser it doesn't accept
  comments. This would be fixed in the future.]]


==== Color
Options in this table controls colors in all the editor.

```toml
[color]
ui = "49;30"                    # All ui text except ui_text_cell
ui_cell_text = "49;39;1"        # Cell text representation and previous message
ui_report = "41;39"             # Error/report message at the bottom right
cell = "49;39"                  # Cell color if not custom color applied
cell_over = "49;39;7;1"         # Cell color if cursor is over cell
cell_selected = "49;32"         # Cell color if selected
ln_over = "49;32;7;1"           # Row/col number/alpha if cursor is in this row/col
ln = "49;32"                    # Row/col number/alpha default color
sheet_ui = "49;39"              # UI elements inside sheet as separators
sheet_ui_over = "45;39;7;1"     # UI elements inside sheet if cursor is over they
sheet_ui_selected = "45;32"     # UI elements inside sheet if assigned cell is selected
insert = "49;39"                # Color used when cell input text is being written
```

==== Window
Despite of the name, in this table lives all the options that are not colors. In
the future it would migrate to another table.

```toml
[window]
num_col_width = 5               # Number column width
col_width = 14                  # Column width (min is cell_l_sep + cell_r_sep + 1)
row_width = 1                   # Other size is not supported
use_cell_color_for_sep = true   # Use cell color for separators instead of sheet_ui
cell_l_sep = " "                # Left separator
cell_r_sep = " "                # Right separator
save_time = 0                   # Time interval (in seconds) where save is call. 0 means no autosave.
use_mouse = false               # Enable mouse capturing

```

This is the ui customization, where you can modify how the editor looks like (Also in #smallcaps("window")).

```toml
# Top bar
status_l_stuff = "vicel | "     # Top Left bar text
status_filename = "filename: "  # Between status_l_stuff and filename
status_r_end = "github: hugoocoto/vicel" # Top right-align bar text

# Bottom bar
ui_celltext_l_sep = "cell text: " # Bottom Left bar text, before cell repr text
ui_celltext_m_sep = " ("        # Between cell text and cell type
ui_celltext_r_sep = ") "        # Before cell type, left-aligned
ui_status_bottom_end = ""       # Bottom right-align text
```
